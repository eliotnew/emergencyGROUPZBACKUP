                    <p>At the end of Session 2 we asked you to try out both positive and negative social skills.</p>
                    <li>How did the positive techniques feel? Did you see any differences from the way you normally behave?</li>
                    <li>How about the negative techniques? Did you notice the differences in the way you felt and others behaved towards you?</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Don't worry if you found this exercise difficult, it can be hard work to change your social skills to begin with, but given time it will become easier. Try starting with something simple like smiling. If you try to remember to smile at people when you're out and about it's surprising the difference it can make.

                    <p class="padded center">These are just a few examples - but good to remember.</p>
                    <br>
                          
                    <p>Remember to listen to the answer! It'll help keep the conversation going.</p>
                    <p>The point is to try and think about how you socialise at the moment. Do you make an effort to be friendly or are you quite shy?</p>
                    <p>Next time you're in a difficult social situation, try to think about how you might act in a positive way. This will help you to enjoy socialising more.</p>
                    <p>Remember you can practice this homework again at any point you feel like it. The key to getting it right is practice, so the more you try the easier it'll get.</p>
