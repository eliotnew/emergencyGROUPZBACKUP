                    <p>People with visible differences, just like you, can feel anxious or nervous in public. That might be when they meet friends or go to places where there are lots of people around, like work or a shopping centre.</p>
                    <p>These feelings can range from feeling self-conscious in front of people, to being unable to leave the house because of worries about other peoples' reactions to their difference, like being stared at or teased.</p>
                    <p>Feeling like this is very uncomfortable and can stop you enjoying your life. Here are some stories from people who have experienced these difficulties. Do any of these sound familiar?</p><br>

I kept on pretending I was sick, nearly every week I’d take a couple of days off work. I’d wake up and think I’m not going into work today and you know they just said 'fine'. I didn’t used to say it was the psoriasis, I used to say things like a headache. I just used to make up rubbish really, but it was the psoriasis. I wasn’t leaving the house, I was like a recluse, it was terrible."</p><br>

                        <p> Organisations such as Changing Faces and the Centre for Appearance Research are doing all they can to raise public awareness of visible differences and the importance of not staring and judging people on the way they look, but they can't change society overnight!

                            In order to help you now, Face IT will help you to manage other people's reactions and to feel more positive about yourself, so you can enjoy life more.</p>

                          It's very common for people with a visible difference to become pre-occupied with (think a lot about) their appearance. This can sometimes become a problem, because the more they focus on and worry about their appearance, the more likely they are to think people are responding negatively to them, when often they're not. Let's use an example to explain this</p><br>

                              But it's not just how others view us that's important - how we view ourselves and how we feel about our own appearance is very important too. If you have a difference that you were not born with, it can often be very difficult to come to terms with the new you.
                              
                              Each of us develops a picture of ourselves in our heads, our body image. Any big change to our body image (we no longer look the way we expect to look) can lead to distress and a sense of not knowing who we are anymore.

It’s quite difficult showing your skin because you wanna look like everyone else and it doesn’t look very attractive. You wanna avoid feeling that you’re being watched or laughed at. Anything that marks you out from the group is a big deal. I tried to find lots of coping mechanisms, like not talking about things and covering up, which is fine in the winter, but in the summer when I’m doing sports and swimming, it's quite hard."</p><br>
