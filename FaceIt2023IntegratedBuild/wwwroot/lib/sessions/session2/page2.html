              <section class="content">
              <p>Good social skills really help people cope with an unusual appearance and they make socialising easier and more fun. When we talk about socialising we mean any time when you're with or talk to other people. This could be meeting new people, talking to people at work, or going to the cinema or shopping in town.
                In this session we are going to help you improve your social skills.</p>
              <p><b>There are 2 parts to improving social skills</b></p>
              <ol>
                <li>The first is learning about the importance of body language.</li>
                <li>The second is learning helpful talking skills.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><b>Why do I need to be taught social skills?</b></p>
              <p>Because they help us to feel more confident, make new friends and discover new opportunities. When you have a visible difference, you're sometimes at a disadvantage because of your appearance. But by using social skills you can overcome many of these disadvantages.</p>
